# Time to First Response 

How much time passes between when an activity requiring attention is created and the first response? 


## Description

The first response to an activity can sometimes be the most important response. The first response shows that a community is active and engages in conversations. A long time to respond to an activity can be a sign that a community is not responsive. A short time to respond to an activity can help to engage more members into further discussions and within the community.


## Objectives

Identify cadence of first response across a variety of activities, including PRs, Issues, emails, IRC posts, etc.  Time to first response is an important consideration for new and long-time contributors to a project along with overall project health. 


## Implementation

Time to first response of an activity = time first response was posted to the activity - time the activity was created.
